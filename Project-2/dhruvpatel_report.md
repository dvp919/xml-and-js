### What is actually my Data is about and How my page is working ? 
- So First, I generate data or JSON file from https://www.mockaroo.com/ and got around 10 fields.
- Then, I have created HTML page where I print my table and the data and drop down menu, radio button and filter dropdown menu
- Then I have linked this file with my Dealer function js file.
- Where I am mapping my json data into table and make functionality to perform my 3 different characteristics as shown below
    - Filter by using any field (e.g Id, firstname, lastname etc).
    - Filter by using radio button where we can see who is selling or buying the car of any model.
    - Filter by Car brand

### How my filter will work ?
#### Filter by using any field
- we have None, id, Firstname, Lastname, Email, Gender, Car , Car Year and IP Address.
- So user can search by any of the above field by giving value in textbox

#### Filter by using radio button
- Here, I have taken 3 fields, (None, Selling or Buying)
- So, basically if someone wants to buy specific car (e.g Ford) so they can filter by clicking on "Buying" radio button like shown as below.
